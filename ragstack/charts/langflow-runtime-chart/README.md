# LangFlow runtime chart

Deploy LangFlow flows to Kubernetes with this Helm chart.

## Import a flow

There are two ways to import a flow:

1. **From a remote location**: You can reference a flow stored in a remote location, such as a URL or a Git repository by customizing the `values.yaml` file in the section `downloadFlows`:

```yaml
downloadFlows:
  flows:
    - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langflow-ai/langflow/dev/tests/data/BasicChatwithPromptandHistory.json
#      basicAuth: "myuser:mypassword"
#      headers:
#        Authorization: "Bearer my-key"
```

2. **Packaging the flow as docker image**: You can add a flow from to a docker image based on Langflow runtime and refer to it in the chart.
   See an example in the `apps` directory.

## Deploy the flow

```
helm install langflow ./langflow-runtime \
    --set "downloadFlows.flows[0].uuid=4ca07770-c0e4-487c-ad42-77c6039ce02e" \
    --set "downloadFlows.flows[0].url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/langflow-ai/langflow/dev/tests/data/basic_example.json" \
    --set replicaCount=2

kubectl port-forward svc/langflow-langflow-runtime 7860:7860

curl -X POST \
    "http://localhost:7860/api/v1/run/4ca07770-c0e4-487c-ad42-77c6039ce02e?stream=false" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\
    -d '{"input_value": "message",
    "output_type": "chat",
    "input_type": "chat",
    "tweaks": {
  "ChatInput-1BPcY": {},
  "ChatOutput-J1bsS": {}
}}'

```
