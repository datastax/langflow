# ðŸ¤— HuggingFace Spaces

HuggingFace provides a great alternative for running Langflow in their Spaces environment. This means you can run Langflow without any local installation required.

In a Chromium-based browser, go to the [Langflow Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow?duplicate=true) or [Langflow v1.0 alpha Preview Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Langflow/Langflow-Preview?duplicate=true).

You'll be presented with the following screen:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/duplicate-space.png",
    dark: "img/duplicate-space.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

Name your Space, define the visibility (Public or Private), and click on **Duplicate Space** to start the installation process. When installation is finished, you'll be redirected to the Space's main page to start using Langflow right away!

## Run a starter project

Langflow provides a range of example flows to help you get started.

Once you get Langflow running in your Space, click on **New Project** in the top right corner of the screen.

Select a starter project from the list, set up your API keys, and click âš¡ Run. This will open up Langflow's Interaction Panel with the chat console, text inputs, and outputs ready to go.

For more information on the starter projects, see the guides below:
